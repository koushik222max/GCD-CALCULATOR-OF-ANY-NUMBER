# Recursive GCD Calculator âš¡

Finding the **Greatest Common Divisor** has never been this clean and quick.  
This Python script uses a **recursive Euclidean Algorithm** to deliver the GCD of any two numbers in no time.

## How It Works
- Prompts the user to enter two integers.
- Recursively applies the Euclidean Algorithm until the remainder is zero.
- Prints the GCD result instantly.

## Example
Enter first number: 48
Enter second number: 18
GCD is: 6

## Why Use It?
Perfect for:
- Math enthusiasts ðŸ§®
- Coding practice ðŸ’»
- Competitive programming ðŸš€

Run it, test it, and see how elegant recursion can be.
